<b>infinity</b> isn't just a tool, its a technique to find out someone's phone number.
It involves social engineering, common sense and maths.

## What it does?
Start a conversation with the victim and find a chance to do the following:
```
You: Hey, I have an awesome trickt to show you. Wanna see?
Victim: Yeah sure.
You: Add all the digits of your phone number.
Victim: Ummmm alright....
You: Whats the result?
Victim: **
You: Now subtract it from your phone number.
Victim: WTF? Alright wait a sec...
You: Yeah. Now whatever the number you get will be divisible by 9. You
can try it with any number, the result will be same.
Victim: That's it? Fucking nerd.
You: So what we were talking about? :')

```
Now we have the sum of his digits, we will call it <b>Magic Sum</b>.
Now open Facebook in a private window, click on forget password option and enter the username of the victim and you will see the following:

Great! We have 2 digits of the number.<br>
Now the next thing you need to do is to find location and carrier of the victim. Use social engineering or old school IP techniques, its upto you.<br>
As we know, mobile numbers have a series (or area codes). For example my phone number starts with <b>8203</b>, this is my series. It depends on my carrier and location. I don't know about other countries but in India, different states can have multiple serieses for a carrier.<br>
Anyways, find out the series using location and carrier. Lets say the series is <b>8203</b>.<br>
Now run <b>infinity</b> and do whatever it says.
